History
=======

Elias and Jean wanted to make a game together.

Jean wanted to code in Rust, Elias wanted to code in Odin.

Instead of persuading one or the other to learn their current favorite
programming language, they decided to split the project into two parts: Jean
would code the core game logic in Rust, and Elias would code the game UI in
Odin.

And that's how Tic-Tac Toe-Toe was born!
